## 🔐 What I Do

I architect **zero-trust security systems** and **embedded finance platforms** at the intersection of cybersecurity and fintech. Currently leading:

- **[Secured Cyber Solutions](https://github.com/FluffyHorizon1)** – Enterprise security consulting & the "Swiss Fort" decentralized infrastructure
- **Bond FinTech** – Quantitative trading systems and embedded credit solutions

> *"The future of investment is autonomous, validated by performance, and secured by cryptography."*

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### 🦭 [SecureSeaHorse](https://github.com/FluffyHorizon1/SecureSeaHorse)
A production-grade **C++ telemetry agent** with mTLS, anti-tamper mechanisms, and zero-trust architecture. Built for high-security environments where standard monitoring solutions fall short.

**Tech:** `C++20` • `OpenSSL` • `mTLS` • `Linux Kernel Modules`

### 🏰 Swiss Fort Architecture
Decentralized server fleet implementing "Compartmentalization by Design":
- **Privacy Gateway** – Swiss-hosted ingress with kernel-level encryption
- **Adversarial Emulation** – Isolated APT simulation sandbox
- **Threat Monitoring** – Real-time SIEM with anomaly detection
- **Sovereign Vault** – Zero-port storage accessible only via encrypted tunnels

### 📈 Quantitative Trading Systems
Proprietary HFT algorithms validated across diverse market regimes. Specialized in crypto arbitrage, order flow analysis, and systematic alpha generation.
